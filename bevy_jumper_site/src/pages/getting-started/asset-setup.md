## Downloading the Assets

For this tutorial I am going to be using an asset pack from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl), you can download the same asset pack [here](https://kenney.nl/assets/jumper-pack). It's not required that you use the same assets but it will make it easier to follow along if you do.

## Add Assets to Bevy

Bevy makes it really easy to import assets, for now all you need to do is create a folder called `assets` in your project and add your assets to it. If your using the same asset pack it should look something like this, I'm going to be using a diferent player character so I left out the `players` folder.

```
ğŸ“¦Project Folder
 â”£ ğŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œmain.rs
 â”£ ğŸ“‚assets
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚Background
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚Enemies
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚Enviroment
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚Items
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚Particles
 â”£ ğŸ“œCargo.toml
 â”— Other Files
```

Under the `Enemies` folder I'm going to sort each character into their own folder to tidy things up a bit, this is optional.

```
ğŸ“¦Enemies
 â”£ ğŸ“‚Cloud
 â”£ ğŸ“‚Fly Man
 â”£ ğŸ“‚Spike Ball
 â”£ ğŸ“‚Spike Man
 â”£ ğŸ“‚Spring Man
 â”£ ğŸ“‚Sun
 â”— ğŸ“‚Wing Man
```
